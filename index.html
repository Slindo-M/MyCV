    <!-- PROFILE -->
    <section>
        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
            I am a business operations associate with a strong foundation
            in finance and business, supported by over four years of combined professional
            experience. My background spans roles as a financial management consultant and
            later as a business development consultant, where I gained hands-on exposure to
            strategy, operations, and advisory work across different business contexts.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am deeply passionate about solving societal challenges in developing countries, particularly
            those related to personal financial management for low- to middle-income individuals.
            I am motivated by the belief that access to the right financial tools, knowledge,
            and systems can meaningfully improve people’s quality of life and economic resilience.
        </p>

        <p>
            My long-term goal is to build a company that develops AI-powered financial tools tailored
            to the needs of the low- to middle-income market. Through this, I aspire to bridge gaps
            in financial inclusion, empower individuals to make better financial decisions, and contribute
            to sustainable economic growth in underserved communities.

                As a Business Development professional at Lungile Holdings, I supported the company’s growth by identifying new business opportunities,

               for decision-making.
                </p>

                <p>
               I collaborated with cross-functional teams to analyze financial performance, identify cost-saving opportunities,
               and optimize resource allocation. My role also involved ensuring compliance with financial regulations
               and implementing best practices in financial management.
